# Making Effort Estimations

For me, the way I made my effort estimations, was to think on a high level what the feature is that needs to be implemented and how complex that would be. Based on how complex, I would rate it with an estimated time that I felt was related to the complexity. 

# Benefits of Estimation

There is a lot of benefits of estimating how long a feature takes to implement. For starters, the time estimation gives you an initial idea of how complex a feature can be. If you see an issue that takes 1 hour vs 4 hours, then already you can tell that the issue that's 1 hour shouldn't be as difficult as the other one. Additionally, they help you stay on track for a project, and understand what kind of resources need to be spent on one issue vs another. A good example is that if you have 3 weeks for a project, and there's a feature that takes maybe 1 week, then you should have the best developer suited for that feature and check up on them to make sure that everying is moving forward without any major blockers. There's so many benefits to estimation of features, but, the largest benefit is to hold you accountable to development and let others know if there is any blockers to implementing your feature or if you are on track. 

# Tracking Actual Effort 

I think tracking the actual effort is very beneficial for a group of people - especially the **project managers** (*scary*). The reason I say that is because after a couple of weeks and then you look at the issues and the estimated and the actual effort, you will know the following: 

1. Developers Skills
2. Developers Strengths and Weaknesses
3. How much time your project is taking

The first 2 are given, but what do I mean by the 3rd one? Well, this relates back to how much time you think your project should take or how much time you're given. If you see that a feature is more complex than it appears to be, then that should ring an alarm to you that there should be some refactoring to the project to make sure that you can deliver the features in the time given. 

# Tracking My Actual Effort

To keep track of my coding effort, I used the `Timer` extension by the user dharmey. It was very accurate in tracking how much coding I've been doing. For non-coding, however, I just guesstimated it, which was not so accurate since I couldn't really tell how much time I actually spent thinking about implementing the feature. 

# Overhead in Tracking Effort

There was some overhead. I think the main thing was forgetting that I had to put down my estimations in the fields. Then having to do so and completely forgetting how much time I actually thought of as estimated effort for both coding and non-coding.
