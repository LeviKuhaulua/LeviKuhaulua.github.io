# Introduction

The role of AI has been expanded and being used in many industries and apps. Just one search, and you can find useful tools to help generate videos, summarize and read textbooks, or help code the next big thing. Software engineering is that field where it can be cumbersome to tackle. You have to communicate with clients (*scary*), decide on the technologies to build your project, *actually* build the project. At it's core, software engineering is the role which you ask "why this" or "what's the best way to do this" or "is this something that takes this long or this long", it is the role of planning and thinking about every decision and how they can help you move forward in building the project that the client wants or a problem in the community that it aims to solve. AI, with all it's knowledge, can help expedite the process in the decision making. At a press of a button, you can get all the information regarding around the latest technology crazes, the best tech stacks, and of course, coding implementations to the problem that's been racking your head. However, AI is **just a tool**, until you can decipher the code it's spitting out or what it summarizes about NextJs, it will lead to headaches about trying to solve the problem you are working on. 

# My Personal Experience

<ol type='1'>
  <li>
    Experience WODS
    <p>
      I have not really used it to help understand concepts like Issues, React, or Functional Programming for example. I believe the reason why is because I have used these before in the club that I'm in so it wasn't really new knowledge to me or something that's confusing.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    In-Class Practice WODS
    <p>
      I did not use AI for the practice WODs I believe. For me, the main thing was to learn and understand how each concepts function. A good example is Bootstrap, since it is the main styling framework that we are using, to me, it would make sense to understand how Bootstraps implements the styling and how it names them. That way, I don't need to refer to any information on the 314 website or in the docs. 
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    In-Class WODs
    <p>
      If I remember correctly I used it one time which was in the <strong>Kō Hana Rum</strong> practice WOD, which was the using just Bootstrap. I was having a tough time implementing the Footer component, specifically the part where it has the logo on top of the address so I asked ChatGPT, "How to use Bootstrap classes in order to have the logo on top of the address?" Unfortunately, none of the answers worked, so I played around with the layout of the columns in order to achieve the same effect. 
    </p>
  </li>  
  <li>
    Essays
    <p>
      No AI was used. My voice represents how I think and how I express those thoughts in essays. If I have AI do the essay for me, then it doesn't truly express my voice.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Final Project
    <p>
      No AI was used. I understood the core concepts of the main functionality / logic behind the site and I was confident in my abilities with Prisma, NextJs, and React + Bootstrap. Opening up ChatGPT and asking it for a solution is not only <i><b>an extra step</b></i>, but it highlights to me that I am not confident in the answer that I came up with. 
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Learning a Concept/Tutorial
    <p>
      Yes. I believe AI is a really good way to getting a lot of sources and information at once involving any topic that you want to learn about. I remember asking ChatGPT to "Please give me sources about Bootstrap and React + Bootstrap." It compiled a lot of sources which helped me understand these frameworks better.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Answering a question in class or in Discord
    <p>
      No. If another classmate posted a question in class or in Discord, to me, they probably did all that they can to find a solution to that question -- assuming it was an issue -- including possibly asking an AI tool, therefore it wouldn't make sense because if I asked ChatGPT, most likely, it is going to find the same "solutions" that my classmate already searched up.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Asking or answering a smart question
    <p>
      No. This relates back to my voice; the way I express my confusion and what I'm stuck on is different from how an AI would do the same thing. It might leave certain parts that are useful or add in random facts that don't really get closer to solving the issue. If I think of the question and send it myself, I can guarantee that what I put closely relates to the part that I'm stuck on. 
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Coding Example
    <p>
      Yes. I have used ChatGPT to ask for coding examples in Bootstrap since I am still learning Bootstrap and don't know all the nuances that comes with it. I prompted ChatGPT by asking "Can you give me an example of a navbar that has links + icons with React + Bootstrap?" What it gave me was a pretty good example about how most Navbars are structured and how I can represent that with <code>Row</code> and <code>Col</code>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Explaining Code
    <p>
      Yes. This goes hand in hand with the code example. I would ask ChatGPT for an example then ask it to explain why it used those things. Such as "Why use <code>Col</code> and not <code>Row</code>? Even though it provided answers to these questions, I still looked them up in documentation in order to validate what ChatGPT is saying.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Writing Code
    <p>
      Yes and no. I remember for the Kō Hana Rum WOD, I would come up with a solution, if it wasn't completing a certain step, I asked ChatGPT, things like "Hey, how do I refactor this to make the first column bigger?" The answer, even though it didn't solve it fully, helped lead me to a solution. 
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Documenting Code
    <p>
      No. Since I either understood the code from ChatGPT or wrote the code myself, I could write the documentation myself. Asking ChatGPT to also document the code is just an extra step that's not really needed.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Quality Assurance
    <p>
      No. There were already tools to do that like <code>npm run lint</code>
      to give me the specific error and <code>npm run lint:fix</code> to fix most of the auto-solvable ones. Any erros that couldn't be solved by the previous command, was pretty simple to handle / deal with.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Other Uses
    <p>
      No. I primarily used AI (ChatGPT) to come up with either resources or that one time in which I had it help me with a solution to Kō Hana Rum.
    </p>
  </li>

# Impact on Learning

AI can either be a great tool or a bad tool. It all depends on how one uses it. For me, AI is great at finding multiple sources in a snap. However, code solutions and code examples can get tricky if I don't know exactly what it's doing. For example, If I didn't know anything about any of the frameworks and relied on ChatGPT, then I wouldn't really be developing skills in them since all I remember would be prompting AI to come up with a solution. Even though it enhances my learning experience, I still have to validate what ChatGPT is saying in order to truly see which information I can keep and ones I can discard.

# Practical Applications

One instance I see AI being used is the ones that involve Help Desk. You know, the ones, where the AI bot is there to assist you. While it can solve a majority of the simpler issues, what about the ones where there is no solution that was given to the bot. One where I need to speak to an Help Desk agent. And I can't find any contact information like a phone number or email on their webpage or through the bot. I think Help Desk and IT is an example of a field where AI won't fully replace people, because, new issues are going to arise that AI isn't trained to solve and there needs to be a person there to critically think about the issue and solve it.

# Challenges or Opportunities

Limitations: It makes it harder to learn. Knowing that I can use a tool like ChatGPT and not get punished for it is very incentivizing to have me just search up a solution without actually knowing how to use React, Bootstrap or Prisma. This concept relates to **Vibe Coding** and how people can just use AI to make a web app or other concepts without actually understanding what the code does. I think an opportunity to show how bad **Vibe Coding** can be to students, is to have them create a solution to a topic that they haven't learned about without actually writing any code and just having the AI write it for them. A good example is the Playwright Tests where we can ask ChatGPT, DeepSeek, or another AI tool to come up with Playwright Tests, then have students compare that with just using `npx playwright codegen` to create the test.

# Comparative Analysis

There is both benefits and downsides to AI in the classroom vs traditional teaching methods. Engagement can increase because information is very important to the user and how they prompt the AI to answer a question. Traditional teaching methods are much less engaged because the usual lecture style is either very boring - like regurgitating information off the slides - or the teacher teaches in a way that students don't learn. Knowledge retention is definitely less beneficial with AI than traditional teaching methods. Traditional, you have to actually use the formulas, theorems, or other concepts given to you and apply them to the problems presented in the class or outside. With AI, all I have to do is just search it up, no actual playing with the code or typing anything, just copy and pasting. Practical skills like problem solving goes down with an over-reliance on AI. The hard part is that it all depends on how the student is using it. 

# Future Considerations

Software Engineering is an industry that is never going away. There will always be people that's needed to solve new unsolved problems. With AI, it can help those people by reducing mental overhead on boring and/or repetitive tasks like fixing lint errors, finding sources, and coming up with tech stacks. To experienced software engineers, it's great; to up and coming software engineers, it's horrible. AI can provide shortcuts on learning key concepts in software engineering, if there's one focus point on integrating AI with education, it's how you can effectively teach a class and have them retain that information if AI is in the classroom. With learning, we want to take the slow, painful route as that can teach us the most about core concepts and knowledge associated with software engineering, that way, we don't introduce bugs that will harm our communities.

# Conclusion

Overall, AI is a great tool that can help people with learning or doing repetitive tasks. However, it is not something that should be used to take a shortcut in the learning experience. The biggest area that we need to work on is making sure that we can get students to use AI in a manner that actually improves their learning process and makes them excited to learn, rather than give them an answer everytime. What would be great is an AI program, that actually gives resources or lectures on topics that rejects any prompts regarding answers to questions. Students will be able to utilize the benefits of AI without taking any shortcuts.
