## Overview

### The Problem

At Farrington High School, they offer Advanced Placement (AP for short) courses that help prepare 9th-12th graders for college-level classes. At the end of the school year, students can take the AP exam and can earn college credit based on their score. However, it is hard to get students to apply for the various APs offered at Farrington due to the lack of marketing and promotion for them. Even though there are tools like Google Sites, it's hard for teachers and staff to utilize them as they have to learn how to use it and also understand and apply core web design principles to market their class in a stylish, informative way; which takes away time that they could use for lesson plans, grading assignments, and preparing them for the exam. 

### The Solution

Using our tech stack, we can implement a web app that abstracts away the design aspect and allows the faculty and staff of the AP program to focus more on updating information for the AP Classes. The idea here is that trusted users can login to the app and then update class availability and information, while students can look at the website to see what classes will be offered for the upcoming school year and get a general idea of what the class is about. 

## Mockup Pages 

1. The Landing - this is our about page that gives students, faculty, and parents the purpose of the Advanced Placement program at Farrington, while also highlighting the benefits of taking an AP Class. 

2. The Classes - the *meat* of our website, which provides the following for students: the ability to view all the courses offered at Farrington and their information such as the subject, description, and the teacher. Not only that, students would also have the ability to filter classes by their subject **or** search for a class by it's name.

3. The Dashboard - this page would allow trusted users of the site to make updates and changes to the classes. For example, people like the AP Coordinator should be able to add new classes, assign teachers to classes, and update information for their classes. Meanwhile, somebody like an AP teacher will only be allowed to update the information for the class that they teach. 

4. The Form - this page will be for students to provide information on their strengths and weaknesses in subjects and then after filling out the form, we will dynamically generate classes that would be best suited from their strengths. 

## Use Cases

- Students can use the site to find out what classes are being offered for the upcoming school year and then sign up for them if they are interested (sign-up process is manual). 
- Students can also plan ahead by finding what classes they are interested in that require pre-requisites, and then making sure that they take those pre-requisites before the application opens for the upcoming school year. 
- Students who are first timers to taking AP classes and want to find out what class(es) are best suited for them can fill out the form and then apply to those classes (if they choose to). 
- AP Coordinators can easily create new classes and mark the ones not offered for the upcoming school year as inactive. Allowing for a more effective management of course availability. 
- Teachers and faculty can easily and efficiently update information on their specific course. 


# Beyond the Basics 

- Using AI, allow students to fill out a form of their general interests and strengths, and then provide them a list of recommended courses they could take. 

- Using AI, develop a system where students can fill out a general questionaire on their goals and classes they have taken, which then provides them with a general roadmap of what APs they can take (including pre-requisites) throughout their high school career to help fastrack their college journey / goals.
