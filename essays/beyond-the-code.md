Throughout school, I learned how to be a developer. Things like *"given \_\_\_, do this"* or *"for this assignment, make sure your program does \_\_\_"*, I could accomplish those assignments well. However, when I advanced to the higher-level classes and started getting into the final projects where there was a lot more freedom in what we could do, I ended up getting stuck. I understood what the prompt was. I knew what the project should look like. However... I didn't know where to start. 

## Hopes with Software Engineering

Going beyond the code, software engineering is more than just writing code to accomplish a specific purpose. Software engineering is really a process or mindset. Meet with the client. Discuss. Learn the core functionality of the app. It's up to us as the engineer to understand the following: (a) What does the client want?, (b) What are the features that are realistic to implement? What are the features that are unrealistic, (c) Who is this app targeting? In other words, software engineering focuses on the nitty-gritty details of a project that range from configuring said project, deciding on the implementation, to troubleshooting and maintaining the project after it's first launch. To me, software engineering is a process that plans out the development of an app starting from the configuration all the way to after it's launch. 

My biggest goal is to understand and start thinking like a software engineer, that way I can grow accustomed to every aspect of software development instead of being focused on just development the software. Thinking like a software engineer would help me in thinking, designing, and ultimately implementing my own projects that can benefit my community.
