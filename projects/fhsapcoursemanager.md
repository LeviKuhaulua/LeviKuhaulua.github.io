<hr>

At Farrington High School, they have a program called Advanced Placement (or AP) that allows students to take college-level courses while in high school to prepare them for the academic rigor of college and also give them a chance to earn college credit. The problem is that when it comes to promoting AP classes, there is little to no marketing on them -- even on the official Farrington website. While teachers could promote them, the underlying issue is that we'll have to: 

1. Teach AP faculty and staff a website editor like Google Sites
2. Have AP faculty consistently update their website with information 
3. Make sure that each site / webpage follows a specific format and styling guide
4. Making sure that the styles look nice. 

The idea here is to use our powers in React, Bootstrap, and Prisma to abstract the designing of the AP Classes and have them actually focus on just entering the important information about the class. Our web app essentially takes in data about an AP Class like the name, teacher, subject, grade levels this class is offered, and much more and then creates a visually appealing design to showcase to students. 

We also integrated AI! We have this feature that allows students to enter their past information like classes taken, GPA, and grade level, and then it will give them a list of classes to take as a roadmap for their time at Farrington High School until they graduate.
