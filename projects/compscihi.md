<hr>
The club that I am apart of, 8bit, is a Web Development club that helps students develop and improve their skills in web development and software engineering. As a member of 8bit, I got to learn about the following:

- Software Development Life Cycle
- Project management
- Tech stacks popular in web development


Our project, <b>Compscihi</b>, is a project that we think can help the community here at UH Mānoa. Specifically, this project allows students to go on and see 
job postings that companies are publishing and where to apply for those opportunities. 

Students would be able to see a lot of helpful information such as: 

- Job Type (Remote, Hybrid, In-Person)
- Job Description
- Benefits
- Preferred Qualifications
- Skills
- Where to Apply

And much more! 

<b>My contributions</b>

- Designed responsive and user-friendly components in React
- Develop the layout for certain pages for the Login and Signup form
