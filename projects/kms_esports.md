summary: "Integrating a server to streamline and better manage all eSports equipment and accounts"
---

**In Progress** 

When I first started managing the eSports arena, I found it hard to manage all the accounts and devices as I would have to juggle between 30 different machines who each had their own unique problems. 

I thought that if I had a server and overall domain, I could streamline eSports operations in the following ways:

- Organize accounts and account permissions for students and eSports technicians
- Create a standard image for desktops to ensure that every desktop has the same apps and background
- Ease of troubleshooting as I would only have to troubleshoot the server instead of the different machines

The benefits of a server could also be extended / implemented for our school as it would help standardize the way we manage and configure equipment for students and faculty. I met with my bosses and I got approval to implement this idea for the eSports arena as a test run. 

I'm hoping that if all goes well and it substantially improves the way we troubleshoot and manage laptops and computers, then we can implement a server to manage all the desktops and accounts for the school.
