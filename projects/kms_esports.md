<hr>

When I first started managing the eSports arena, there were a lot of issues that occurred with the desktops. 
These issues ranged from not having the right apps to students being able to download software that **definitely** shouldn't be downloaded or allowed. 
Not only that it became hard to manage these desktops as I would have to troubleshoot 30 different desktops that each had their own unique problem. 

Something that I thought would help to improve the way I manage the eSports equipment and accounts was to have a server and a domain
that all the computers could be apart of. That way, accounts and account permissions can be more easily organized, a standard image
could be created for all desktops, and in general, an overall easier time to troubleshoot issues. I met with my bosses, and I was
able to get the idea approved and get in contact with a few people in our district who could help me set up the server. 

With the contacts, I was able to set up the server and successfully add all the eSports computers to the domain and get managed by the server. I was able to set up the following: 

1. A shared drive that all player accounts can access (read-only) to see login credentials
2. Restricted access to changing desktop background, colors, and installing software
3. Set up auto-updating for computers

**Next Steps**

The initial server setup was great but there is still more to do. The next big challenge is to set up a deployment server to set up images for the eSports computers and the faculty devices. With that, we can mass deploy and set up devices. After that, we'll see, it could be getting all the staff computers on the domain and manage them as well, or set up shared drives and give accesses and permissions to certain people.
