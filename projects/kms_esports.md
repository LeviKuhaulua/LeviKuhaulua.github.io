**In Progress**

When I first started managing the eSports arena, there were a lot of issues that occurred with the desktops. 
These issues ranged from not having the right apps to students being able to download software that **definitely** shouldn't be downloaded or allowed. 
Not only that it became hard to manage these desktops as I would have to troubleshoot 30 different desktops that each had their own unique problem. 

Something that I thought would help to improve the way I manage the eSports equipment and accounts was to have a server and a domain
that all the computers could be apart of. That way, accounts and account permissions can be more easily organized, a standard image
could be created for all desktops, and in general, an overall easier time to troubleshoot issues. I met with my bosses, and I was
able to get the idea approved and get in contact with a few people in our district who could help me set up the server. 

My role in this collaboration involved me finding a suitable PC to act as the server. After finding a suitable PC, I sat down with 
the contacts and they helped guide me to start downloading the appropriate OS (Windows Server 2025) and configure key aspects like the Domain and IP Address for the server. 
I hope that in my next meeting, I can then learn how to set up the group permissions and policies for accounts. Overall, this project
is helping me learn the aspects involved in both setting up a server (hardware requirements to networking), to eventually how to use a server
to manage groups of devices and accounts.
