<hr>

At Farrington High School, students can take college-level classes that can help prepare them for when they get into college
and serves as an opportunity for them to earn college credit. 

This project that I am still <b>currently</b> working on, serves as a way for students to get the following information about 
AP: 

- What exactly is AP? 
- How do I apply to AP? 
- What kind of AP courses are offered at Farrington? 
- Any information on events or socials about AP
